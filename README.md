This project focuses on cryptocurrency price forecasting using real-world data collected from the Binance API.
The dataset was preprocessed and analyzed through detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in price movement, volatility, and trading volume.

A series of forecasting models were implemented and compared to identify the most accurate and best-fitting approach for the dataset.
Model evaluation was carried out using performance metrics and visualization insights to assess accuracy and consistency.

To complement the analysis, Power BI dashboards were integrated to provide interactive visualizations and deeper insights into time series behavior.
